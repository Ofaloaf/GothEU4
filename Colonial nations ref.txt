# General notes

# A couple colonial regions have either been split altogether or replaced with a different colonial region, because I am sperging hard.
# as follows:
# Alleghania		Northern part of the Eastern America colonial region
# Appalachia		Southern part of the Eastern America colonial region, except for
# Florida		It's Florida
# Ohio			Taken from part of Louisiana and the Eastern America regions. It's the US side of the Great Lakes region, more or less.
# Mississippi		Replaces the Louisiana region. Why would Louisiana be called Louisiana in a scenario with no Frenchmen?
# Equinoctialia		Replaces the Colombia region. Derived from 'equinoctialis', like Australia from 'australis'.
# Terranova		Newfoundland, Labrador and Greenland. Look, historically that all operated separately from Canada proper up to 1949.
# Platina		A rename of the La Plata region. 'La Plata' is such a Spanish-specific name, why would anybody else use the Spanish form?

# 'Floating' colonial revolters can be established in any colonial region, and will gain a claim over whatever colonial region they're in once formed.
# They're sort of meant as a stopgap for when I can't be bothered making special revolters for every culture for every region.


# if no tag is provided, it's because I haven't gotten to that point yet.
