 EVTNAMEflavor_goth2:0 "The Spirit of Reform"
 EVTDESCflavor_goth2:0 "The development of the Gothic legal system gradually demanded greater levels of reform within Gothia. Not only the system of law, but the very system of government itself needed dramatic reform in order to deal with the complex nature of the Lex Gothica."

 free_cities.1.d:0 "The city of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] has been granted Imperial Immediacy as an Imperial Free City of the Western Roman Empire. While there are many important self-governed cities in the Empire [Root.GetName] now has something beyond its wealth and size to protect it - economic and political freedoms perpetually guaranteed by the Emperor himself."

 EVTNAMEGNOSTIC1:0 "The Gnostic Revival"
 EVTDESCGNOSTIC1:0 "The Conciliarist schism, combined with the reintroduction of old theological texts through the new scholasticism of the Renaissance, has created fertile ground for more heresies to take root. Gnostic teachings in particular have become popular in $CAPITAL$, and it seems like it may become the home to a new movement."
 EVTNAME2001:0 "The Conciliarist Movement"
 EVTDESC2001:0 "Rejection of the Roman Orthodox Church and the Patriarch in Constantinople is spreading across Europe as a result of the increasing corruption of monks and clerics. Voices are being raised, questioning the rising power of the Patriarch over the other bishops of Christendom. A monk in $CAPITAL$ has for some time expressed deep concerns and is now openly calling for powers to be stripped from the Patriarch, paving the way towards a reformation of the faith."

 EVTNAME2002:0 "Spread of Conciliarism"
 EVTDESC2002:0 "The increased secularization of the Patriarchate and its growing power has gradually evoked concern across Europe. Reform-minded bishops and laymen in $PROVINCENAME$ have begun to reorganize their local church structure according to Conciliarist practices."

 EVTOPTA2012:0 "OK"
 EVTNAME2011:0 "The Further Reformation"
 EVTDESC2011:0 "The explosion of Reformed beliefs has, thus far, largely focused on matters of theology and administration. Conciliarists want a reformed church structure, and Gnostics try to promote a different view of the cosmos. A preacher in $CAPITAL$ has denounced all these movements as empty gestures, missing the entire point of the church. He has called upon the faithful to focus on individual piety, and applying Christian morals strictly to congregants' personal lives."

 institution_events.5.t:0 "Global Trade"
 institution_events.5.d:0 "Goods have been moved across continents since antiquity. But where this was previously limited to a set number of routes and goods such as the manufactured goods of India and China finding their way across the Indian Ocean and along the Silk Road, all trade is now increasingly becoming part of a greater world network. With the discovery of the Americas, sea routes around Africa and the crossing of the Pacific Ocean, local trade networks are being connected into one world-spanning interconnected web.\nSilver mined in the Andes is now being boxed and taken via Europe all the way to China and India. Iron mined and wrought in Scandinavia is being sold in West Africa by Frankish merchants and others are making a fortune just distributing cloth and spices within the South East Asian trade sphere. Local Indian merchants are investing in future European trade ventures. It may still be early to speak of a truly Global Economy but surely the first seeds have been sown."
