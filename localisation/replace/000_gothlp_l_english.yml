 western_men_at_arms:0 "Gregarii"
 western_men_at_armsDESCR:0 "Gregarii were professional soldiers in Western European armies of the late middle ages. Knights and noble families would employ a number of men at arms to form their retinue. They would tend to be better armed and armored than the ordinary feudal footsoldier. Gregarii were those soldiers who fought on horseback or with heavy weaponry, but were not of a high social standing and so could not be referred to as Knights. The better equipped and better trained were known as Sergeants at Arms."
 gaelic_galloglaigh:0 "Numerian Militia"
 gaelic_galloglaighDESCR:0 "First prominently found in records of the classical Imperial Roman army, the 'Numerus' was a initially barbarian soldier allied to the Romans, but not integrated into their military. Later, the Numerus became a regular infantryman within a frontier Limitanei unit of the later Imperial period. Although the exact nature of the Numerus as a soldier has changed over time, the general idea remains the same."
 italian_condotta:0 "Bucellarii"
 italian_condottaDESCR:0 "Literally translating to 'biscuit-eaters', bucellarii are soldiers in private employ, rather than directly serving the state. In classical times, bucellarii tended to serve as bodyguards and personal armies for prominent generals and politicians. These units can be thousands strong, and often served alongside the regular army in war when their employers were involved."
 swiss_landsknechten:0 "Contaric Infantry"
 swiss_landsknechtenDESCR:0 "The 'contus', or pike, was often used by Germanic soldiers through the classical and medieval eras. The Goths particularly took a shine to the weapon, and even as they became Romanized in Gaul they never quite let go of their traditional Germanic weaponry."
 gaelic_mercenary:0 "Reformed Numeri"
 gaelic_mercenaryDESCR:0 "As the armies of Europe embraced increasingly complex armaments, logistics and methods of organization, the classical Numerus became a more professionalized soldier. The purchase of weapons was conpensated by the state, if the state did not directly supply standardized arms itself, and pay was increased for men serving on the frontier."
 spanish_tercio:0 "Armigeri Infantry"
 spanish_tercioDESCR:0 "The growing size of armies and the lethality of weaponry demanded better protective measures for soldiers. The reintroduction of 'Armigeri' units provided a means of doing so, by combining arquebusiers in with pikemen and pavisiers to create a dense formation brimming with weapons."
 gaelic_free_shooter:0 "Improved Maniple"
 gaelic_free_shooterDESCR:0 "The growing size of armies and the challenges of maneuver demanded better methods of organization for soldiers. The reintroduction of the maniple was one such way that this was addressed. Manipular formations allowed armies to quickly change their orientation, their breadth and their depth. The default drill for maniples, coincidentally, created a shallower formation for the infantry, increasing firepower for the unit."
 dutch_maurician:0 "Pyrio Infantry"
 dutch_mauricianDESCR:0 "Advances in metallurgy and gunpowder corning led to the increasing prevalence of muskets in battle. 'Pulveri Pyrio', that explosive powder that made guns more than a tube of metal, had proven itself to be one of the most important materials in war."
 irish_charge:0 "Improved Comitatenses"
 irish_chargeDESCR:0 "Advances in metallurgy and training led to the increasing emphasis on the offensive in battle. The old Roman comitatenses field army was reinvented to take advantage of these developments, creating new pike and shot units that excelled at harrying their opponents and engaging them at close quarters."
 austrian_tercio:0 "Reformed Armigeri"
 austrian_tercioDESCR:0 "The Armigeri proved to be the last gasp of heavy armor's role in Early Modern warfare. The increasingly potent massed fire of muskets was proving to be a serious danger even to those equipped with the toughest plate armor, but the Armigeri's dense square formations helped lessen the deadliness of these attacks and allowed them to continue fighting in their mixed ranged-and-melee manner for decades more."
 swedish_gustavian:0 "Reformed Pyrio"
 swedish_gustavianDESCR:0 "Advances in musketry proved to be the death knell for heavy armor's role in Early Modern warfare. The increasingly potent massed fire of muskets was proving to be a serious danger even to those equipped with the toughest plate armor, and the potency of firearms only grew with each decade of development."
 scottish_highlander:0 "Federate Infantry"
 scottish_highlanderDESCR:0 "With European states demanding more and more manpower to fuel their wars, the use of foreigners in armies began to grow. Aping the old Roman foederati system, states began offering incentives to draw foreign adventurers and mercenaries into their service. Like the foederati of old, this ocassionally caused problems for the states, but for the most part this proved to be an effective means of increasing a realm's military strength."
 austrian_grenzer:0 "Ripensian Infantry"
 austrian_grenzerDESCR:0 "As states grew outwards, frontier defences both in Europe and the colonies took on a new importance. No fledgling empire could survive with porous borders and settlements open to raiding! Thus, garrisons were subject to reoganization, and whole new units were created solely for the purpose of patrolling and protecting the frontier."
 swedish_caroline:0 "Auxiliary Infantry"
 swedish_carolineDESCR:0 "As states grew outwards, new peoples were brought into old states, and new uses were found for them. Rather than solely relying on old centers of recruitment, states could now tap into the varied populations of their lands to create new units of new peoples, who could either serve as reserves or as front-line shock troops."
 austrian_white_coat:0 "Palatine Infantry"
 austrian_white_coatDESCR:0 "The cream of many European armies was the Palatini, the palace troops who could and would fight for their ruler on any battlefield at anytime, and answered to no one but their sovereign. Dedicated to the regime, they offered both withering fire on the attack and a stalwart defense when pushed back."
 french_bluecoat:0 "Pseudocomital Infantry"
 french_bluecoatDESCR:0 "The comitatenses army model encountered significant difficulties in the 18th century, primarily regarding manpower. The extreme demands placed upon many men in comitatenses was simply too much for the increasingly levy-reliant armies of the period, and compromises had to be made. One organizational innovation which helped prolong the life of the model was the introduction of the 'expansible' comitatenses, one that retained a core unit of well-trained soldiers that would be supplanted with draftees when war broke out. The trained veterans provided much-needed experience to the unit, and the levies helped beef up the army's manpower."
 british_redcoat:0 "Legio Pyrii"
 british_redcoatDESCR:0 "Some classically-minded leaders in the 18th century attempted reintroducing more elements of the ancient Roman legion. The model of enlistment and service established by the Romans seemed like a potentially suitable way to create a modern standing army without any undue reliance on peasant levies and short-notice conscriptions. In practice, things were not so neat, but the idea persisted."
 prussian_fredrickian:0 "Reformed Auxilia"
 prussian_fredrickianDESCR:0 "Continuing demands for more manpower led to a formalization of the federate and auxiliary units previously established on an ad hoc basis. Reformed auxilia units were fully integrated into a state's military structure and heirarchy. Their main point of difference from an army of regulars was the usage of foreign nationals within the ranks."
