This is a scenario based upon the "Let's Wear Black" LP on the Something Awful forums. The LP was a super-megacampaign, starting off in Attila Total War before moving onto CK2 and then EU4. I played as the Ostrogoths in the Attila Total War section of the LP, and then as 'Gothia' from CK2 onwards.

The two biggest changes in Europe (and I do mean big) are that the Goths managed to survive (in Gaul, rather than Italy or Spain) and that the Western Roman Empire became incredibly weak, but didn't completely die off. In the Attila Total War section of the LP, the WRE was driven out of Italy by rebels, and became a little rump state in Spain. In CK2, the WRE remnant clawed back control of Spain, and then was taken over by a Gothic dynasty that managed to reconquer most of the old territories of the WRE, but only by radically decentralizing and turning the empire into an elective monarchy. For EU4, HRE mechanics were used for this decentralized empire with an elected monarch.
